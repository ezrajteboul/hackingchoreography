===================

pseudo code for programming/choreographing musicians

//
original project by Kate Sicchio

original repo is https://github.com/sicchio/hackingchoreography

// the new piece acts like code usually does, i.e. it defines stuff and then makes the stuff happen in some order with some standard code-things. The ones I understand are if/then statements and all that, the stuff I don't totally get is defining and using functions. Cool thing, since it's pseudocode my understanding doesn't matter, just an understanding with the performers. Anyways in a performance you'd declare the same things suggested in the main experiment1.txt file and then "interpret" in real time by reading the instructions on a screen while playing your instrument. That folder contains some examples of possible sequences and tricks.
